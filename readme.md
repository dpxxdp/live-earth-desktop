# live-earth-desktop

**UPDATE: GOES-East now supported instead of Himawari.** Use https://github.com/jakiestfu/himawari.js for Himawari images instead of this. Something has changed about where the Himawari images are saved, and I don't want to spend time tracking it down when there's a perfectly great package already. You can use his script via `launchctl` the same way you can this one in order to get continually-updated images for your desktop. GOES-East is still supported in this package.

There's a satellite called Himawari-8 which is geostationary over approximately Papua New Guinea. The very excellent people who run this satellite have set up a [live stream](http://himawari8.nict.go.jp/) of the ultra-high-res images that it takes. They are gorgeous.

Similarly, there's another satellite called GOES-East. It's above South America at the equator, and its photos are just as amazing as the Himawari ones. Because the NOAA is excellent people too, they also have [live images available](https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/GOES/GOES16_FullDisk.php).

Inspired by [someone awesome on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/441do9/i_made_a_windows_powershell_script_that_puts_a/), and based on a script by [celoyd](https://github.com/celoyd), I built a script that downloads the latest photo. With a `plist` file for `launchd` on OS X, I can run this script every ten minutes and always have the latest image on my machine. And then by setting my OS X desktop to a slideshow of the images inside a folder, the latest Himawari-8 or GOES-East photo is always set as my desktop image.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repo
2. `pip3 install Pillow requests pytz tzlocal lxml scikit-image opencv-python bs4`
1. Pick whether you want images of Australia and Southeast Asia (Himawari) or the Americas (GOES-East).
3. Change the paths set in `tmp` and `out` and `os.system("rm ...")` in `himawari.py` or `goes-east.py` and those in `himawari.plist` or `goes-east.plist` to paths inside this directory.
4. Try the Python script by running `python3 himawari.py` or `python3 goes-east.py` just to make sure everything's kosher. It should download an image.
5. `ln -s /inmanlabs/workspace/live-earth-desktop/himawari.plist /Users/danielbarrett/Library/LaunchAgents/` or `ln -s /inmanlabs/workspace/live-earth-desktop/goes-east.plist /Users/danielbarrett/Library/LaunchAgents/`
6. `launchctl load -w /Users/danielbarrett/Library/LaunchAgents/himawari.plist` or `launchctl load -w /Users/danielbarrett/Library/LaunchAgents/goes-east.plist` to start it running every 10 minutes
7. Go to OS X Preferences > Desktop and Screen Saver and set your desktop to rotate through the images contained in the `images` directory that you're writing these images to (whatever directory you made `out` point to).
8. Enjoy!
